# Feature-Point-Detection-in-LiDAR-point-cloud

This repository consists of the implementation of the Final year BTech project **Feature Point Detection in LiDAR point cloud** under the guidance of Dr. Subhasree M, Associate Professor, CSED, NIT Calicut. 
The code belongs to Gowri B Kumar and J Sivsankar, students of National Institute of Technology, Calicut.

### Abstract ###
LiDAR technology has a wide range of applications. A critical aspect involving the processing of the dataset is registration. However, due to the nature of the point cloud, direct processing of the dataset is very demanding. Feature point detection in the LiDAR point cloud can be an efficient way of pre-processing and compressing this dataset, enabling better representation and, thus, enabling better registration. Hence, it is imperative to develop a robust, automatic, and self-learning method to deal with the problem and that does not limit itself to a particular type of scan environment

### Problem Definition
The project aims to develop a model to identify and segregate feature points from a LiDAR point cloud.
#### a. Input specification
The input is a LiDAR point cloud(s) comprising the vast array of three-dimensional data points generated by a LiDAR
sensor.

#### b. Output specification
The expected output is a distinct dataset containing the identified feature point set of the LiDAR point cloud.
